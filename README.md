## For open in developer mode:

In the project directory you need to install dependency, open cmd on your pc and copy-paste. After installing the
dependencies, go to point 1.1 or 1.2:

### `npm install`

1.1 For open without Docker in the project directory, you should open cmd and copy-paste:

### `npm start`

1.2 To open with Docker, you need to have Docker on your computer or download and install it (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/). Then open in the project directory cmd and copy-paste:

### `docker-compose up`

Wait until there is no information about readiness in the terminal, and open this link in a browser:

### `http://localhost:3000/`
